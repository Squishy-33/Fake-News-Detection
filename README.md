# Fake-News-Detection

I worked on this project as part of the Foundations of Data Science course at Sapienza university and it addresses the issue of fake news detection using Long Short-term Memory architecture. Our specific goal was to identify the fake news using the text and title of the articles. We used NLTK to extract tokens, lemmas, POS and GloVe for lemmas embedding in order to feed data with more features and improve the results. Our best F1-score was 99.97% with a precision of 99.96% and recall 99.98%.
